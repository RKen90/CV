  <h3>About me</h3>

  <p>
    I am a highly motivated and professional graduate, with experience in teaching,
    heritage, and retail sector. I have excellent organisational skills, and am reliable and
    confident in all situations.
  </p>
  <p>
    I have a strong education and can adapt quickly to new situations. I graduated with
    Honours in History from the University of Glamorgan and subsequently studied an MA
    in English at Cardiff Metropolitan University. I have developed a passion for Computer
    Sciences and their use in the classroom and am preparing to begin studying an MSc in Computer
    science with software development.
  </p>

  <p>
    I have completed a PGCE teaching degree where I taught a minimum of 80% of lessons,
    covering the whole curriculum. In my final teaching observations I received excellent in
    a number of areas, particularly my assessment and differentiation, demeanour, and
    leadership within a classroom. I have been praised for the standard of my English
    lessons and the quality of resources that I produce.
    I have spent the last two years working in International schools in Egypt where I taught
    Year 6, 7 and 8 classes full time. I was head of English for Primary and helped to
    introduce new schemes into the school. I was also able to introduce a new behaviour
    management policy to assist the school. I am looking to further develop my teaching
    career in the international field.
  </p>

  <p>
    I have become passionate about Computing and Programming and am developing my skills to
    persue a career in this industry.
